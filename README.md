To improve my understanding and skills of the C, C++ language, algorithm, data structure and etc,
I'm reviewing C, C++ programming language, algorithm, data structure, etc again and organizing contents.
I plan to organize each term and concept.

[Caution] The source code may differ from that written on the referenced site. (Modified and in use)

I update the source code or summary file daily :) (Except for work/employment preparation/special day like family trip)
- These days, I am learning about developing vehicle-related devices for work, so I have not been able to upload other study materials. (data not allowed to be disclosed)
- Once I enter a stable period related to work, I will upload study materials.

Reference site link:  (Later, I will share the homepage link that I referred)

If you have any question about contents, please contact me.

To improve my understanding and skills of the C language,

I'm reviewing C programming language again and organizing contents in C language.
I plan to organize each term and concept.


The source code may differ from that written on the referenced site. (Modified and in use)


If you want to see the source code, check "practice.cpp" file.

If you want to see the summary of C language, check "everything in c.pptx" file.

If you want to see the algorithm, check "algorithm_prac.cpp" file.

I update the source code or summary file daily :)

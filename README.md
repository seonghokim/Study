To improve my understanding and skills of the C, C++ language,

I'm reviewing C, C++ programming language again and organizing contents in C, C++ language.
I plan to organize each term and concept.

Caution: The source code may differ from that written on the referenced site. (Modified and in use)


If you want to see the source code, check "practice.cpp" file.

If you want to see the summary of C language, check "everything in c.pptx" file.

If you want to see the algorithm, check "algorithm_prac.cpp" file.

If you want to see the algorithm details, check "Algorithm in c.pptx" file.

If you want to see the summary of C++ language, check "everything in c++.pptx" file.

The written language in the .pptx file is a mix of Korean and English.

I update the source code or summary file daily :)

Later, I will post information related to "embedded SW" and also organize materials related to "machine learning" that will be studied in the future.
(I don't know when I will work on it... But, I should do it!)
